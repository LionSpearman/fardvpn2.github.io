<h1 class="title"> Food Security </h1>
		
		<p>  
		Food security is crucial to our partner institution’s sustainability and prosperity. Considering <br>
		the institution is an independent institution, they can only rely on themselves to provide<br>
		their basic needs; the fluctuating nature of donations is not a reliable enough source <br>
		of food/resources on its own. <br><br>
		
		Currently, the institution is using their community business endeavors to sustain their cash <br>
		flow and their food security. In the interview, Miss Marisol, the president of the SAKADAB <br>
		institution had mentioned that each member equally contributes and works in different departments <br>
		depending on their skill sets such as crocheting, sewing, and maintaining a store of their own. <br>
		This shows how the institution’s creativity and resourcefulness amidst the problems they face <br>
		particularly about food scarcity but with factors such as the economic blow the pandemic had on <br>
		any smaller businesses and the institution’s lack of awareness, the institution is in need of some <br>
		assistance. <br><br>
		
		The institution’s method  to manage kitchen waste is currently not known however, based on the most <br>
		commonly used methods here in the Philippines, we can assume that SAKADAB follows the majority in <br>
		depending on the government’s garbage collection service. <br><br>
		
		According to the National Institute of Health, most communities depend on the government’s garbage <br>
		collection to deal with their waste which majority of the time, ends up in our landfills to rot. <br></p>
		
		<h3 class="subtitle1"> Converting Kitchen Waste into Valuable Resources </h3> 
		
		<p>
		Rice, vegetables, and meat – the most wasted types of food here in the Philippines according to the <br>
		Department of Science and Technology (DOST). But this wasted food is not only another meal not eaten <br>
		but also an opportunity that is wasted. So here are three easy methods to deal with each type of food type. <br><br></p>
		
		<div class="chart">
			<div class="chart-plan">
			  <h2>Rice</h2>
			  <p> Unused rice can be creatively repurposed into a nutritious meal, 
				highlighting its adaptability across diverse Filipino recipes. A prime example is its conversion into Adobo rice,
				a process that not only transforms leftover rice but also offers a chance to effectively utilize any residual vegetable oil.</p>
			  <a href="https://booky.ph/blog/leftover-rice-recipe/">Source</a>
			</div>
			<div class="chart-plan">
			  <h2>Vegetables</h2>
			  <p>Vegetable waste, particularly from items like potatoes, garlic, and lettuce, 
				can be repurposed by replanting the scraps to yield a fresh crop. This not only reduces vegetable waste but also establishes a sustainable food source. 
				Given the financial constraints of the SAKADAB institution, this approach can alleviate the burden of food costs in their budgeting.</p>

			</div>      
			<div class="chart-plan">
			  <h2>Meat</h2>
				<p>Meat waste finds purpose in supporting strays, a simple yet impactful solution. In the SAKADAB institution, caring for at least one dog, possibly more, 
					involves considerable expenses. By redirecting meat waste to feed the dog, it alleviates costs, 
					a practical approach despite the affordability of commercial dog food.</p>
			</div>
		  </div>
		<br>
		<div class = "chartSummary">
		<p>We can turn kitchen waste into a valuable resource by maximizing its usage so that it can become a sustainable source 
			of food and save financial resources as well. The methods we had given prior to this help find a new use for 
			leftover food and make it into new meals that can be reused and made into yet another meal for either the human
			members of the SAKADAB institution or the animal ones as well. On the other hand, the other method allows them to 
			create their own food and make a sustainable source of food that they can upscale indefinitely the more they 
			consume their own food and are left with more leftovers. In summary, the kitchen waste that otherwise would’ve been 
			thrown out or left to rot is now able to become a sustainable resource that they can use for their own personal 
			consumption by making sure to find a use for every single piece of wasted or unused resources. </p>

			  <h2>Abstract</h2>
			  <p>Vegetables are one of the most wasted foods in Filipino households, and as an institution made-up by multiple households, SAKADAB is no exception to this fact. With no waste management systems in place, their kitchen waste ends up in landfills to decompose and become methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide. This research aims to find ways to convert vegetable leftovers into an activated carbon filter and to see how it would affect the potability of different types of water. We believe that the activated carbon can filter and make tap and rainwater potable.

				To test this, 3 kilograms of vegetable waste is cooked in a stove at 400 fahrenheit for 3-5 hours and crushed into a fine powder. After being activated with a lemon juice and water solution, it is dried and used to filter the three water samples. A coliform bacteria test is done to check the bacteria content, turbidity meters and litmus papers are used to see the turbidity and pH levels of the water samples to determine their potability.
